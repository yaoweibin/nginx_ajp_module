# Description

With this module, Nginx can connect to AJP port directly. The motivation of writing these modules is Nginx's high performance and robustness.

# Directives

## ajp\_buffers

__syntax:__ _ajp\_buffers the\_number is\_size;_

__default:__ _ajp\_buffers 8 4k/8k;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive specifies the number and the size of buffers, into which will be read the response, obtained from the AJP server. By default, the size of one buffer is equal to the size of a page. Depending on platform this is either 4K, 8K or 16K.

## ajp\_buffer\_size

__syntax:__ _ajp\_buffer\_size the\_size;_

__default:__ _ajp\_buffer\_size 4k/8k;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive sets the buffer size, into which will be read the first part of the response, obtained from the AJP server.

In this part of response the small response-header is located, as a rule.

By default, the buffersize is equal to the size of one buffer in directive `ajp_buffers`; however, it is possible to set it to less.

## ajp\_cache

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache zone;_

__default:__ _off_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

The directive specifies the area which actually is the share memory's name for caching. The same area can be used in several places. You must set the `ajp_cache_path` first.

## ajp\_cache\_key

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache\_key line;_

__default:__ _none_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

The directive specifies what information is included in the key for caching, for example

        ajp_cache_key "$host$request_uri$cookie_user";

Note that by default, the hostname of the server is not included in the cache key. If you are using subdomains for different locations on your website, you need to include it, e.g. by changing the cache key to something like

        ajp_cache_key "$scheme$host$request_uri";

## ajp\_cache\_methods

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache\_methods \[GET HEAD POST\];_

__default:__ _ajp\_cache\_methods GET HEAD;_

__context:__ _main,http,location_

GET/HEAD is syntax sugar, i.e. you can not disable GET/HEAD even if you set just

        ajp_cache_methods  POST;

## ajp\_cache\_min\_uses

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache\_min\_uses n;_

__default:__ _ajp\_cache\_min\_uses 1;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Sets the number of requests after which the response will be cached.

## ajp\_cache\_path

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache\_path /path/to/cache \[levels=m:n keys\_zone=name:time inactive=time clean\_time=time\];_

__default:__ _none_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive sets the cache path and other cache parameters. Cached data stored in files. Key and filename in cache is md5 of proxied URL. __Levels__ parameter set number of subdirectories in cache, for example for:

        ajp_cache_path  /data/nginx/cache  levels=1:2   keys_zone=one:10m;

file names will be like:

/data/nginx/cache/c/29/b7f54b2df7773722d382f4809d65029c

## ajp\_cache\_use\_stale

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache\_use\_stale \[updating|error|timeout|invalid\_header|http\_500\];_

__default:__ _ajp\_cache\_use\_stale off;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

If an error occurs while working with the AJP server it is possible to use a stale cached response. This directives determines in which cases it is permitted. The directive’s parameters match those of the `ajp_next_upstream` directive.

Additionally, the updating parameter permits to use a stale cached response if it is currently being updated. This allows to minimize the number of accesses to AJP servers when updating cached data.

## ajp\_cache\_valid

__syntax:__ _ajp\_cache\_valid \[http\_error\_code|time\];_

__default:__ _none_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Sets caching time for different response codes. For example, the following directives

        ajp_cache_valid 200 302 10m;
        ajp_cache_valid 404      1m;

set 10 minutes of caching for responses with codes 200 and 302, and 1 minute for responses with code 404.

If only caching time is specified

        ajp_cache_valid 5m;

then only 200, 301, and 302 responses are cached.

In addition, it can be specified to cache any responses using the any parameter:

        ajp_cache_valid 200 302 10m;
        ajp_cache_valid 301      1h;
        ajp_cache_valid any      1m;

Parameters of caching can also be set directly in the response header. This has a higher precedence than setting of caching time using the directive. The “X-Accel-Expires” header field sets caching time of a response in seconds. The value 0 disables to cache a response. If a value starts with the prefix @, it sets an absolute time in seconds since Epoch, up to which the response may be cached. If header does not include the “X-Accel-Expires” field, parameters of caching may be set in the header fields “Expires” or “Cache-Control”. If a header includes the “Set-Cookie” field, such a response will not be cached. Processing of one or more of these response header fields can be disabled using the `ajp_ignore_headers` directive.

## ajp\_connect\_timeout

__syntax:__ _ajp\_connect\_timeout time;_

__default:__ _ajp\_connect\_timeout 60s;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive assigns a timeout for the connection to the upstream server. It is necessary to keep in mind that this time out cannot be more than 75 seconds.

This is not the time until the server returns the pages, this is the [ ajp\_read\_timeout](#ajp_read_timeout)  statement. If your upstream server is up, but hanging (e.g. it does not have enough threads to process your request so it puts you in the pool of connections to deal with later), then this statement will not help as the connection to the server has been made.

## ajp\_header\_packet\_buffer\_size

__syntax:__ _ajp\_header packet\_buffer\_size;_

__default:__ _ajp\_header\_packet\_buffer\_size 8k;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Set the buffer size of Forward Request packet. The range is (0, 2^16).

## ajp\_hide\_header

__syntax:__ _ajp\_hide\_header name;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

By default, Nginx does not pass headers "Status" and "X-Accel-..." from the AJP process back to the client.  This directive can be used to hide other headers as well.

If the headers "Status" and "X-Accel-..." must be provided, then it is necessary to use directive ajp\_pass\_header to force them to be returned to the client.

## ajp\_ignore\_headers

__syntax:__ _ajp\_ignore\_headers name \[name ...\];_

__default:__ _none_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive(0.7.54+) prohibits the processing of the header lines from the proxy server's response.

It can specify the string as "[X-Accel-Redirect](https://metacpan.org/pod/NginxXSendfile)", "X-Accel-Expires", "Expires" or "Cache-Control".

## ajp\_ignore\_client\_abort

__syntax:__ _ajp\_ignore\_client\_abort on|off;_

__default:__ _ajp\_ignore\_client\_abort off;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive determines if current request to the AJP-server must be aborted in case the client aborts the request to the server.

## ajp\_intercept\_errors

__syntax:__ _ajp\_intercept\_errors on|off;_

__default:__ _ajp\_intercept\_errors off;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive determines whether or not to transfer 4xx and 5xx errors back to the client or to allow Nginx to answer with directive error\_page.

Note: You need to explicitly define the error\_page handler for this for it to be useful. As Igor says, "nginx does not intercept an error if there is no custom handler for it it does not show its default pages. This allows to intercept some errors, while passing others as are."

## ajp\_keep\_conn

__syntax:__ _ajp\_keep\_conn on|off;_

__default:__ _ajp\_keep\_conn off;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive determines whether or not to keep the connection alive with backend server.

## ajp\_next\_upstream

__syntax:__ _ajp\_next\_upstream \[error|timeout|invalid\_header|http\_500|http\_502|http\_503|http\_504|http\_404|off\];_

__default:__ _ajp\_next\_upstream error timeout;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Directive determines, in what cases the request will be transmitted to the next server:

- error — an error has occurred while connecting to the server, sending a request to it, or reading its response;
- timeout — occurred timeout during the connection with the server, transfer the request or while reading response from the server;
- invalid\_header — server returned a empty or incorrect answer;
- http\_500 — server returned answer with code 500;
- http\_502 — server returned answer with code 502;
- http\_503 — server returned answer with code 503;
- http\_504 — server returned answer with code 504;
- http\_404 — server returned answer with code 404;
- off — it forbids the request transfer to the next server Transferring the request to the next server is only possible when nothing has been transferred to the client -- that is, if an error or timeout arises in the middle of the transfer of the request, then it is not possible to retry the current request on a different server.

## ajp\_max\_data\_packet\_size

__syntax:__ _ajp\_max\_data\_packet\_size size;_

__default:__ _ajp\_max\_data\_packet\_size 8k;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Set the maximum size of AJP's Data packet. The range is \[8k, 2^16\];

## ajp\_max\_temp\_file\_size

__syntax:__ _ajp\_max\_temp\_file\_size size;_

__default:__ _ajp\_max\_temp\_file\_size 1G;_

__context:__ _http, server, location, if_

The maximum size of a temporary file when the content is larger than the proxy buffer.  If file is larger than this size, it will be served synchronously from upstream server rather than buffered to disk.

If ajp\_max\_temp\_file\_size is equal to zero, temporary files usage will be disabled.

## ajp\_pass

__syntax:__ _ajp\_pass ajp-server [ajp-secret_];

__default:__ _none_

__context:__ _location, if in location_

Directive assigns the port or socket on which the AJP-server is listening. Port can be indicated by itself or as an address and port, for example:

        ajp_pass   localhost:9000;

using a Unix domain socket:

        ajp_pass   unix:/tmp/ajp.socket;

You may also use an upstream block.

        upstream backend  {
                server   localhost:1234;
        }

        ajp_pass   backend;
        
You may also add secret as second parameter.

        ajp_pass backend secret;

## ajp\_secret

__syntax:__ _ajp\_secret ajpsecret

__default:__ _none_

Directive assigns the secret of the AJP-server. 
        
## ajp\_pass\_header

__syntax:__ _ajp\_pass\_header name;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Permits to pass specific header fields from the AJP server to a client.

## ajp\_pass\_request\_headers

__syntax:__ _ajp\_pass\_request\_headers \[ on | off \];_

__default:__ _ajp\_pass\_request\_headers on;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Permits to pass request header fields from the client to server.

## ajp\_pass\_request\_body

__syntax:__ _ajp\_pass\_request\_body \[ on | off \] ;_

__default:__ _ajp\_pass\_request\_body on;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Permits to pass request body from the client to server.

## ajp\_read\_timeout

__syntax:__ _ajp\_read\_timeout time;_

__default:__ _ajp\_read\_timeout\_time 60_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

Directive sets the amount of time for upstream to wait for a AJP process to send data.  Change this directive if you have long running AJP processes that do not produce output until they have finished processing.  If you are seeing an upstream timed out error in the error log, then increase this parameter to something more appropriate.

## ajp\_send\_lowat

__syntax:__ _ajp\_send\_lowat \[ on | off \];_

__default:__ _ajp\_send\_lowat off;_

__context:__ _http, server, location, if_

This directive set SO\_SNDLOWAT. This directive is only available on FreeBSD

## ajp\_send\_timeout

__syntax:__ _ajp\_send\_timeout time;_

__default:__ _ajp\_send\_timeout 60;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive assigns timeout with the transfer of request to the upstream server. Timeout is established not on entire transfer of request, but only between two write operations. If after this time the upstream server will not take new data, then nginx is shutdown the connection.

## ajp\_store

__syntax:__ _ajp\_store \[on | off | path\] ;_

__default:__ _ajp\_store off;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive sets the path in which upstream files are stored. The parameter "on" preserves files in accordance with path specified in directives _alias_ or _root_. The parameter "off" forbids storing. Furthermore, the name of the path can be clearly assigned with the aid of the line with the variables:

        ajp_store   /data/www$original_uri;

The time of modification for the file will be set to the date of "Last-Modified" header in the response. To be able to safe files in this directory it is necessary that the path is under the directory with temporary files, given by directive `ajp_temp_path` for the data location.

This directive can be used for creating the local copies for dynamic output of the backend which is not very often changed, for example:

        location /images/ {
                root                 /data/www;
                error_page           404 = @fetch;
        }

        location @fetch {
                internal;
                ajp_pass           backend;
                ajp_store          on;
                ajp_store_access   user:rw  group:rw  all:r;
                ajp_temp_path      /data/temp;

                root               /data/www;
        }

To be clear ajp\_store is not a cache, it's rather mirror on demand.

## ajp\_store\_access

__syntax:__ _ajp\_store\_access users:permissions \[users:permission ...\];_

__default:__ _ajp\_store\_access user:rw;_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive assigns the permissions for the created files and directories, for example:

        ajp_store_access  user:rw  group:rw  all:r;

If any rights for groups or all are assigned, then it is not necessary to assign rights for user:

        ajp_store_access  group:rw  all:r;

## ajp\_temp\_path

__syntax:__ _ajp\_temp\_path dir-path \[ level1 \[ level2 \[ level3 \] \] \] ;_

__default:__ _$NGX\_PREFIX/ajp\_temp_

__context:__ _http, server, location_

This directive works like [client\_body\_temp\_path](https://metacpan.org/pod/NginxHttpCoreModule#client_body_temp_path)  to specify a location to buffer large proxied requests to the filesystem.

## ajp\_temp\_file\_write\_size

__syntax:__ _ajp\_temp\_file\_write\_size size;_

__default:__ _ajp\_temp\_file\_write\_size \["#ajp buffer size"\]  \* 2;_

__context:__ _http, server, location, if_

Sets the amount of data that will be flushed to the ajp\_temp\_path when writing. It may be used to prevent a worker process blocking for too long while spooling data.
